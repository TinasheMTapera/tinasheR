# sort_uniq

Here are a few functions that I am creating as shorthands for some of commonly used
expressions/combined functions I keep coming back to. The idea is to read this package
and its functions into any random project I'm working on so I can have these
shorthands, handy (even if they don't seem very R-like).

```{r examples-sort_uniq}
vec <- sample(1:10, size = 20, replace=TRUE)

vec

sort_uniq(vec)
```



A funny thing I ended up realizing when trying to write a "simple test":

There's a tiny probability that this could fail randomly and it wouldn't even be wrong! So the lesson here is don't write tests like mine.

# len_uniq
    
  
```{r example-len_uniq}
vec <- sample(1:10, size = 20, replace=TRUE)

vec

sort_uniq(vec)
```

  
  

# not_in

And finally, an actually personally irritating one of mine: NOT %in%. The fact that we can't
put in a `!%in%` or `not %in%` like in Python is one example where I can
actually say Python did it better than R here.
  
```{r example-not_in}
#' \dontrun{
#'     not_in(1, 2:10)
#' }
```
